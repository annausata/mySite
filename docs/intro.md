# Unknown facts about the Earth


**The temperature in the Earth's orbit is + 4 Â°C**

1. More than 8,000 pieces of space debris orbit our planet.

2. The distance to the nearest star (after the Sun) from us (Proxima Centauri) is 4.24 light years.

3. Scientists believe that every sixth star has Earth-like planets. This means that there may be about 33 billion habitable planets in our Galaxy alone.

4. People always see the same side of the moon. The Earth's gravitational field slows down the Moon's rotation around its axis, so the planet completes its rotation in the same time. Also, the far side of the Moon is more hilly compared to the visible side.

5. The International Space Station is the most expensive object in human history. The ISS has been in Earth's orbit since 1998. The price of creating and maintaining the station in a working condition, according to approximate estimates of experts, is already approaching or has even exceeded 150 billion dollars.

6. The largest meteorite that fell to Earth is the 2.7-meter Hoba. It was discovered in Namibia. The meteorite weighed 60 tons and was 86% iron, making it the largest piece of naturally occurring iron on the planet.

7. If the Earth revolved around the Sun in the opposite direction, the year would be two days shorter.

8. We will remind you that the Moon itself does not shine. The glow that we observe at night is the light of the Sun reflected by the Earth's satellite.
